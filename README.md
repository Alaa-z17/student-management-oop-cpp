# Student Management System (OOP C++)

A console-based student management application built with Object-Oriented Programming principles in C++. This system allows users to perform CRUD operations on student records, track academic performance, and manage student data persistently using file storage.

## 📌 Features

- **Student Management**
  - Add new students with details (Name, Age, Email, Grade)
  - List all students with formatted output
  - Find students by full name
  - Update student information (Email, Grade)
  - Delete students (soft delete with file persistence)
  
- **Statistics & Analytics**
  - Total student count
  - Number of passed/failed students
  - Average grade calculation
  - Top student identification
  - Letter grade conversion (A+, A, B+, etc.)

- **Data Persistence**
  - Automatic saving to `Students.txt`
  - Load students from file on startup
  - Soft delete system (marks deletion without immediate removal)

- **Validation & Utilities**
  - Input validation with range checking
  - Email format validation using regex
  - Phone number format validation
  - Comprehensive date handling class
  - String manipulation utilities

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++17
- **Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming
- **File I/O**: Standard fstream library
- **Data Structure**: STL Vector
- **Validation**: Regular Expressions (regex)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- Make/CMake (optional, for build automation)

### Compilation

**Using g++:**
bash g++ -std=c++17 student-management-oop-cpp.cpp -o StudentManagementSystem
Using Visual Studio:

Create a new Console Application project

Add all header files to the project

Build and run

Running the Application
bash
./StudentManagementSystem   # Linux/Mac
StudentManagementSystem.exe # Windows
📖 Usage Guide
Main Menu Options
List All Students - Display all students with formatted table showing:

Name, Age, Email, Grade, Letter Grade, Status (Pass/Fail)

Statistics (Total, Passed, Failed, Average, Top Student)

Add New Student - Input student details with validation:

First Name & Last Name

Age (4-120 years)

Email (valid format required)

Grade (0-100)

Delete Student - Soft delete by full name:

Shows student card for confirmation

Marks as deleted (removes from file)

Update Student - Modify existing student:

Update email and grade only

Maintains original name and age

Find Student - Search by full name:

Displays detailed student information

Show Statistics - Overview of:

Total students

Pass/fail counts

Average grade

Top performer

Exit - Close the application

Data Storage Format
Student records are stored in Students.txt with the format:

text
FirstName#//#LastName#//#Age#//#Email#//#Grade
Example:

text
[John#//#Doe#//#20#//#john.doe@example.com#//#85.5]
🎯 Key Classes Overview

⚠️ Notes
The application uses soft delete (students are marked as deleted but not physically removed from the file)

Student count updates automatically when adding/deleting students

Email validation uses regex pattern: (\w+)(\.?\w+)*@(\w+)(\.(\w+))+

Age validation: 4-120 years

Grade validation: 0-100
